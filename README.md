- 👋 Hi, I'm Leonardo Fernando, I'm graduated in systems analysis and development. I consider myself an enthusiast in the field of video game development and game design.
- 👀 I am interested in game development in Unity 3D Engine when I was finishing my degree.
- 🌱 I am currently learning and practicing about SOLID and development patterns.
- 💞️ I try to collaborate with projects focused on game development, independent of the Engine.
