* Hi, I'm Leonardo Fernando, I'm graduated in systems analysis and development. I consider myself an enthusiast in the field of video game development and game design.
* I am interested in game development in **Unity 3D Engine** when I was finishing my degree.
* I am currently learning and practicing about **SOLID** and **development patterns**.
* I try to collaborate with projects focused on game development, independent of the Engine.
